- uniq.c should not have been handed in

- 1)  char C = 'C';
      char *cp = &C;

      char words[] = "some words"
      char *ap = words;

      int num = 1;
      int *p = &num;
      int **pp = &p;

  2)  Yes you can. its void *point = &point;

  3) the problem is that the loop ends when it reches the address \0. this program will continu to loop pointing to the next point in memmory untell a segmentation falt happens.
     to fix it the loop should be for(p=s: *p != '\0'; p++) this will have the loop continue intell it reads the null bite. 

  4) (a) this is correct in that the variable holds the address to the fist element of the array, meaning that the variable name for an arry is a pointer.
     
     (b) this is incorrect in that an array is a data struckture that holds data in sequental spaces in memory.
   
  5) strerror returns the non 0 number if there is a problem so that numb needs to be able to change while strerror igets a messege t
