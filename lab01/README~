- run using a.out

- 1. unix1
  2. man(1) I learned that man files are difficalt to understand. 
  3. I cose emacs because I dont really understand what ime doing yet and I heard you say the name
  4. it rights a string to the terminal as output. I strugled with the emacs editor and getting the progrm to complie and run. This in a terminal 
     is brand new to me.

- I would apprecete some feedback if i didnt comple it correctly but it works when i ran it.
